Source distribution for the package PyDCG, which includes discrete and 
computational geometry tools.

There are 2 options to install it:

1. Using distutils: untar (unzip) contents and run 

      python setup.py install
    
   inside the created folder. To specify an install directory, use 
   the --prefix option:

   python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/installation/folder
   
   To uninstall, simply delete the folders PyDCG-0.0.1 crated in the 
   instalation directory.
   
2. Using pip: run

      pip install PyDCG-0.0.1.zip
      
   To uninstall, run
   
      pip uninstall PyDCG
      
   NOTE: There is currently a bug when installing with pip, the instalator
   doesn't show the question 'Download point sets? (~600 Mb) Y/N ' but it 
   does wait for the answer. Just type Y or N to continue the installation.
    
A C++ compiler with C++11 support  (e.g. GCC 4.7) is required since the package
includes extensions written in the new standard.
