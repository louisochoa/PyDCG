{"name":"Pydcg","tagline":"A Python Library of some implementations for Discrete and Combinatorial Geometry.","body":"=====\r\nPyDCG\r\n=====\r\n\r\nSource distribution for the package PyDCG, which includes discrete and \r\ncomputational geometry tools.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 options to install it:\r\n\r\n1. Using distutils: untar (unzip) contents and run \r\n\r\n      python setup.py install\r\n    \r\n   inside the created folder. To specify an install directory, use \r\n   the --prefix option:\r\n\r\n   python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/installation/folder\r\n   \r\n   To uninstall, simply delete the folders PyDCG-0.0.1 crated in the \r\n   instalation directory.\r\n   \r\n2. Using pip: run\r\n\r\n      pip install PyDCG-0.0.1.zip\r\n      \r\n   To uninstall, run\r\n   \r\n      pip uninstall PyDCG\r\n      \r\n   NOTE: There is currently a bug when installing with pip, the instalator\r\n   doesn't show the question 'Download point sets? (~600 Mb) Y/N ' but it \r\n   does wait for the answer. Just type Y or N to continue the installation.\r\n    \r\nA C++ compiler with C++11 support  (e.g. GCC 4.7) is required since the package\r\nincludes extensions written in the new standard.\r\n\r\nThe name of the package is PyDCG, the modules it contains at the time\r\nare: \r\n\r\n- combinatorics\r\n- crossing\r\n- crossingCpp\r\n- datastructures\r\n- geometricbasics\r\n- geometricbasicsCpp\r\n- holes\r\n- holesCpp\r\n- line\r\n- points\r\n- visualizer\r\n- visualizer2\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the docs folder for the documentation on each module.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
